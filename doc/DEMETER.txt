The strong form of the law restricts access to instance variables to only
those variables defined in the class in which the method appears.  Access
to instance variables from superclasses must be mediated through the use of
accessor functions.

Law of Demeter (strong form).  Inside a method it is only permitted to
access or send messages to the following objects:
1. The arguments associated with the methods being executed (including the
   self [or this] object).
2. Instance variables defined in the class containing the method being
   executed. *
3. Global variables.
4. Temporary variables created inside the method.


[ * In the case of Mica, "class containing the method" should read "object containing the method being executed" ]
