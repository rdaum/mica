I wrote this in 2003. It is not finished.  It is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, using multiple dispatch and prototype-inheritance, backed by a persistent object database. The intended use was for multiuser programmable extendible virtual environments ala LambdaMOO.

In 2003 this compiled with the following dependencies and instructions. It is unlikely it would do so now.

   * Sleepycat DB (aka Berkeley DB)
	http://www.sleepycat.com/

   * Boost
        http://www.boost.org/

   * readline (should come with your distribution)

   * log4cpp
	http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/	

   * Dolphin/Whale lexer/parser generator
	http://hirvi.cs.queensu.ca/whale/

   * autoconf 2.5.3

To actually build the project, do:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
