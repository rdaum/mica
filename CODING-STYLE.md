## Coding Guidelines

### Rust Code Style

- **Edition**: Rust 2024
- **Formatting**: Use the project's specific formatting rules:
  ```bash
  # Format all code
  cargo fmt --all
  ```
- **Naming**:
  - Modules: `snake_case`
  - Types: `PascalCase`
  - Traits: Verb-noun combinations
  - **Important**: Names must describe what code does, not implementation details or history
  - **Avoid**: Implementation details ("JsonParserImpl", "RedisWrapper"), temporal context ("NewAPI",
    "LegacyHandler"), pattern names unless they add clarity
- **Imports**: All `use` statements at top of file/module (avoid per-function imports)
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Rust code -- with its extensive use of matching over ADT -- can trend
  towards deeply nested code that becomes increasingly difficult to read. To avoid this there are a
  number of techniques:
  - **Early Returns**: Short-circuit out of your function on _negative_ conditions, leaving the
    _positive_ case for last. This helps the reader understand the codeflow and emphasizes the
    function's overall purpose.
    - Handle error cases and invalid conditions first
    - Return early with `?` operator for `Result`/`Option` types
    - Makes the "happy path" clear and uncluttered
  - **Let-else statements**: Use `let else` for conditional binding with early returns on failure
  - **Match let-chains (Rust 1.95)**: Put dependent pattern checks in `match` guards to avoid nested
    `if let` and separate the successful path from the failure cases.
  - **Avoid `else` branches**: Generally prefer early returns over `else` branches on `if`
    statements
  - **Factor out into separate functions**: Break complicated deeply nested blocks into smaller,
    focused functions

#### Example: Match let-chains to avoid nested guards

```rust
match item {
    Some(value) if let Ok(qty) = compute(value) => {
        println!("{value} has quantity {qty}");
    }
    _ => {}
}
```

In this pattern:
- only the successful branch stays in the main arm body,
- invalid data falls through to the `_` arm,
- and the pattern matching logic remains flat and readable.

#### Example: Transforming Nested Code to Early Returns

**Before (Deeply Nested):**

```rust
fn process_user_input(input: &str) -> Result<User, Error> {
    if !input.is_empty() {
        let trimmed = input.trim();
        if trimmed.len() >= 3 {
            if let Ok(user) = User::parse(trimmed) {
                if user.is_valid() {
                    Ok(user)
                } else {
                    Err(Error::InvalidUser)
                }
            } else {
                Err(Error::ParseFailed)
            }
        } else {
            Err(Error::TooShort)
        }
    } else {
        Err(Error::EmptyInput)
    }
}
```

**After (Early Returns):**

```rust
fn process_user_input(input: &str) -> Result<User, Error> {
    if input.is_empty() {
        return Err(Error::EmptyInput);
    }

    let trimmed = input.trim();
    if trimmed.len() < 3 {
        return Err(Error::TooShort);
    }

    let user = User::parse(trimmed)?;

    if !user.is_valid() {
        return Err(Error::InvalidUser);
    }

    Ok(user)
}
```

**Using let-else:**

```rust
fn process_user_input(input: &str) -> Result<User, Error> {
    let trimmed = input.trim();
    if trimmed.is_empty() {
        return Err(Error::EmptyInput);
    }

    let Ok(user) = User::parse(trimmed) else {
        return Err(Error::ParseFailed);
    };

    user.is_valid().then_some(user).ok_or(Error::InvalidUser)
}
```

- **Comments**: Describe what code does NOW, not historical context or implementation details

### Performance Considerations

Performance is paramount, especially in critical paths in protocol parsing or buffer management

- Prefer low or zero-copy solutions where possible
- Follow cache-friendly patterns
- Consider vectorization for amenable problems
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Measure your changes before and after
- If you're writing code which is an optimization... prove it!

### Dependency Policy

We avoid gratuitous Cargo dependencies. Every dependency is part of the system's
long-term maintenance surface, and every transitive dependency is code we may
need to audit, reason about, build, and debug.

- Prefer the standard library and existing workspace crates when they are a
  reasonable fit.
- Add a new crate only when it provides clear value that would be expensive,
  risky, or distracting to reproduce locally.
- Keep dependency versions centralised in the root workspace `Cargo.toml`.
  Member crates should use `workspace = true` instead of specifying versions.
- Before adding a dependency, inspect its transitive dependency graph, feature
  defaults, licence, maintenance state, and whether it pulls in async runtimes,
  logging stacks, serialization frameworks, or platform code we do not need.
- Disable default features when practical and enable only the features Mica
  actually uses.
- Avoid dependencies for small helpers, thin wrappers, trivial derive
  conveniences, or one-off algorithms that are clearer to write directly.
- Be especially conservative in low-level crates such as `mica-var` and
  `mica-relation-kernel`, where dependency choices affect the whole stack.

The goal is not zero dependencies. The goal is a transitive dependency set that
is small enough, stable enough, and intentional enough that we can understand
it.

## Testing

### Testing Philosophy

We follow strict testing practices:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Don't Overuse Mocked Behavior**: Tests should exercise real logic where possible
- **Clean Output**: Test output must be pristine to pass
- **Test-Driven Development**: TDD can be a helpful approach - write tests first when practical
